# Pangenomic analyses of antibiotic-resistant Campylobacter jejuni reveal unique lineage distributions and epidemiological associations
***Campylobacter jejuni* Bioinformatics Analysis - MDHHS and Manning Lab Collaboration**

## Description:
This repository contains the scripts utilized for bioinformatics and statistical analysis associated with [Rodrigues et al., 2023 publication in Microbial Genomics](https://doi.org/10.1099/mgen.0.001073)
The work is a collaboration between the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) and the [Manning Lab](https://manninglab.natsci.msu.edu/) at Michigan State University.

## MicroReact Link:
As described in the publication, a [Microreact Link](https://microreact.org/project/dCGmMiVxreTFjNaqKC68gX-rodrigues-ja-et-al-microbial-genomics-2023) is available to view the phylogeographic analysis.

### Key Features:
- Raw Data Management
- Genome Assembly and Annotation
- Comparative Genomics
- Phylogenetics
- Antibiotic Resistance
- Data Visualization
- Statistical Analyses

## Bioinformatics Drawing:
Please see the incredibly artistic flowchart below! This flowchart has a step-by-step breakdown of the bioinformatics pipeline, including the software used, inputs, outputs, and specific files for this publication.
